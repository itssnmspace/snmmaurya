A controller spec is an RSpec wrapper for a Rails functional test
It allows you to simulate a single http request in each example -

rendered templates
redirects
instance variables assigned in the controller to be shared with the view
cookies sent back with the response

to specify outcomes- 

standard rspec matchers (expect(response.status).to eq(200) )
standard test/unit assertions (assert_equal 200, response.status )
rails assertions (assert_response 200 )
